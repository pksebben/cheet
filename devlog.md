Cheet has undergone some pretty drastic changes since the old cli.
There is now a fully functional web app, with only one feature from
the 'old' cheet remaining (that of vim editing; it was too cool not to
use).  That said, I've archived the old version of cheet (parts of it,
at least) in /old_cheet/ for posterity and because I want to
reimplement a cli and compiling / desktop rendering at some point.
